# EKG Review Module

This project customizes a REDCap data entry form to enable a d3.js EKG viewer and pulling of data files from a GCP bucket.

Be sure to configure the external module settings before use.

All users doing data review should be places in DAGs.  Non-dag users will see a normal REDCap data entry form.
